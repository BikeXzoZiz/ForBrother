          <p class="card-text">Durian is the most famous tropical fruit in Southeast Asia and has the reputation of “Tropical Fruit King”. Southeast Asia produces the most in Thailand. At present, most of the fresh durians seen in the Chinese market are imported from Thailand.</p>

        <p><b>About the durian season in Thailand</b></p>
            
            <p>In Thailand, eating durian is seasonal. Usually the durian season is from mid-March to mid-June (eastern Thailand) and from mid-June to the end of October (Southern Thailand). (These two seasons are usually the mature season of durian.) Of course, sometimes there will be accidents. If the durian meets the rainy season while the flowering season, the durian lotus is knocked down, then this season will not be able to harvest a large number of durians.

                With the continuous evolution of durian varieties, the variety of Golden Pillow Durian is now the most sought-after variety in both Thailand and China. Because of its unique taste, texture, many friends who love durian are full of praise</p>
            
        <p><b>About the nutritional value of durian</b></p>
            
            <p>Durian is a warm fruit. It can provide us with energy and carbohydrates. After the durian is digested, people usually feel that their body is warm. The warmth of durian can improve the coldness of the abdomen and promote the rise of body temperature. It is very helpful for friends with cold constitution and can improve dysmenorrhea. It contains high sugar and contains starch, protein, and a variety of vitamins, fats, calcium, iron and phosphorus. Debilitated friends can eat durian, durian can supplement the body’s energy and nutrition, to achieve physical fitness, nourishing yin and yang. It can be used to nourish the body and strengthen immunity after the illness and women’s postpartum.

                Durian contains very rich dietary fiber, which can promote bowel movements and treat constipation. However, it should be noted that eating durian to treat constipation may require drinking more water. Otherwise, the rich fiber will not absorb water, but will absorb the water in the intestine.
                
                Durian Dabu, the Cantonese said: “A durian three chickens.” “Ci Hai” and “Compendium of Materia Medica” all say that it is “available for medicinal purposes, sweet and warm, non-toxic, attending violent and cold-hearted.” Soup with durian, which can be turned into soup to make the soup white, It is sweet and sweet. The locals use it to replenish after the illness and after the birth.
                
                Chinese writer Yu Dafu wrote in “Nanyang Travel Notes” that “durian has the smell of stinky cheese mixed with onions, and has a scent of turpentine, which is really smelly, fragrant and delicious.” This is the most authentic portrayal of durian. For those who have never eaten durian, as long as they dare to try the first bite, many people will think that the more they eat, the more they want to eat. Many people have tasted the taste of durian and are even addicted.</p>
